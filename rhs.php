        Your support hoisted me among India's <span class="strong">Top 10 biking bloggers</span>. I'm now finalist in the <a href="http://tw.xbhp.com/home/about" target="_blank">True Wanderer</a> contest. Join me as I blog live all through a 7 day ride via uncharted territories, misty mountains and blistering highways... A quest to winning a superbike, one mile at a time.

        I'm a rider from the South and I hand craft web based software to make a living. What started as a personal diary of memorable travels, became a public blog and eventually encouraged me to ride all over India. Visit <a href="http://www.praveenselvam.com">my website</a> for more info. I've also completed a <a href="http://www.ironbutt.com/ridecerts/getdocument.cfm?DocID=30" target="_blank">Saddle Sore 1600K</a> on my Ninja, but haven't registered it with the IBA.
